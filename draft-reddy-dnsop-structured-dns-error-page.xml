    <abstract>
      <t>It can be valuable to communicate computer-parsable details about
      DNS filtering to assist troubleshooting, problem resolution, and end
      users.  This document describes structured data to provide these
      details.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>In DNS filtering scnearios where DNS filtering is provided by an
      entity other than the recursive resolver itself, it is desirable to
      propagate information from the DNS filter provider to the end user
      to assist with understanding the reason the DNS response was filtered
      and to troubleshoot false positives.  There are two architectures
      commonly deployed from the perspective of the local recursive
      resolver when it receives a DNS query from an endpoint:
      <list style="symbols">
	<t>parallel: Two DNS queries are generated, one to a DNS
	filtering service, the other to recursive resolver.  If the
	response from the filtering service indicates the DNS query
	should be filtered, the response from the recursive resolver
	is dropped and a filtered response is sent in response to the
	original query.</t>
	<t>serial: One DNS query is generated to the recursive
      resolver, which itself interacts with a DNS filtering service.
      This relationship with the DNS filtering service might be
      partially or fully withheld (that is, not disclosed) from the end-
      user or might be information available to the end user.</t>
    </list></t>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>This document makes use of the terms defined in <xref

      <t>'Encrypted DNS' refers to any encrypted scheme to convey DNS
      messages, for example, DNS-over-HTTPS <xref target="RFC8484"></xref>,

    <section anchor="format-sec" title="Structured Data">
      <t>To receive structured DNS error page data, the client queries
      the Error Page URI returned in
      [reddy-dnsop-structured-dns-error] with Content-Type:
      application/json+structured-dns-error.  The JSON has one
      top-level name, responsible, containing an array of dictionaries
      for each party responsible for this particular DNS filter.  An
      array of responsible parties are possible in deployment
      scenarios where two or more entities both performed DNS
      filtering (perhaps for the same reason, perhaps for different
      reasons).  The contents of the array are as follows:</t>
      
      <t><list style="hanging">
	<t hangText="complaint:">an array of URIs for the user to report mis-classified
	DNS filtering.  This will often solely contain an https URI, but an array is
	provided in case telephone or email or other URIs are necessary.  This field
	is mandatory, and MUST contain at least one URI.</t>
	<t hangText="justification:">textual justification for this particular DNS
	filtering.  This field is optional.</t>
	<t hangText="name">the human-friendly name of the organization that
	filtered this particular DNS query.  This field is optional.</t>
	<t hangText="regulation">the URI of the regulation authority for this
	DNS query being filtered.  This might point at an employment agreement (for
	an enterprise performing filtering) or a national government
	regulation (for an ISP performing filtering).  This field is optional.</t>
      </list></t>


      <t>The JSON data can be displayed to the user, logged, or otherwise used
      to assist the end-user or IT staff with troubleshooting and diagnosing
      the cause of the DNS filtering.</t>

    <section title="Deployment Considerations">
      <t>Over time a domain may be considered risky, then safe, then
      risky again, and minutes or hours can elapse between the DNS
      EDNS0 error and the user reporting a false positive and the DNS
      filtering service receiving the user's complaint.  Thus the URI
      is RECOMMENDED to include sufficient detail to determine the
      state when the DNS EDNS0 response was generated.  How this is
      encoded into the URI is an implementation decision.</t>
      <t>As discussed in the Introduction, some deployment models allow
      the DNS filter provider to be conveyed to the end user.  This can be
      conveyed with a single Responsible array by encoding the upstream
      DNS error URI as a URL encoded parameter.</t>
      <t>An array allows multiple DNS filters to be provided by specialized
      services.  For example, one service might filter malware distribution
      while another service filters malware command and control, another
      filters malicious look-like login pages, and the fourth is a bespoke
      system used by a consortium of enterprises in the same business
      space (e.g., financial companies).</t>
