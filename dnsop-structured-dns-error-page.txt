1.  Introduction

   Where DNS filtering is provided by an entity other than the DNS
   forwarder itself, it is desirable to propagate some information from
   the DNS filter provider to the end-user to understand the reason for
   the filtering and to troubleshoot false positives.  This document
   describes a complement to [I-D.reddy-dnsop-error-page] where
   computer-parsable data can be exchanged between systems.

   There are two architectures commonly deployed from the perspective of
   the DNS forwarder when it receives a DNS query from an endpoint:

   Parallel:  Two DNS queries are generated, one to a DNS filtering
      service and another one to a recursive resolver.  If the response
      from the DNS filtering service indicates that the DNS query should
      be filtered, the response from the recursive resolver is dropped
      and a filtered response is sent in response to the original query.
      This architecture is often used in home network deployments.

   Serial:  One DNS query is generated to the recursive resolver, which
      itself interacts with a DNS filtering service.  This relationship
      with the DNS filtering service might be partially or fully
      withheld (that is, not disclosed) from the end-user or might be
      information available to the end-user.  This architecture is often
      used in enterprise networks.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499].

   'Encrypted DNS' refers to any encrypted scheme to convey DNS
   messages, for example, DNS-over-HTTPS [RFC8484], DNS-over-TLS
   [RFC7858], or DNS-over-QUIC [I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsoquic].

3.  Structured Data

   To receive structured DNS error page data, the client MUST query the
   Error Page URI returned in [I-D.reddy-dnsop-error-page] with Content-
   Type set to "application/json+structured-dns-error".  The JSON has
   one top-level name, "responsible", containing an array of
   dictionaries for each party responsible for this particular DNS
   filter.  An array of responsible parties are possible in deployment
   scenarios where two or more entities are involved in a DNS filtering
   (the filtering may be for the same or distinct reasons by each
   involved DNS filter service).  The content of the array is structured
   are as follows:

   complaint:  Is an array of URIs for the user to report mis-classified
      DNS filtering.  This is likely to solely contain an "https" URI,
      but an array is provided in case telephone numbers or email or
      other URIs are necessary.  This field is mandatory and MUST
      contain at least one URI.

   justification:  Includes the textual justification for this
      particular DNS filtering.  This field is optional.

   name:  is the human-friendly name of the organization that filtered
      this particular DNS query.  This field is optional.

   regulation:  the URI of the regulation authority for this DNS query
      being filtered.  This might point at an employment agreement (for
      an enterprise performing filtering) or a national government
      regulation (for an ISP performing filtering).  This field is
      optional.

   The JSON data can be displayed to the user, logged, or otherwise used
   to assist the end-user or IT staff with troubleshooting and
   diagnosing the cause of the DNS filtering.

4.  Examples

   The examples use the folding defined in [RFC8792] for long lines.

   An example with one entity, "example.net", that has filtered a DNS
   query is shown in Figure 1, below.

   {
     "responsible": [
       {
         "complaint": [
           "mailto:helpdesk@example.net?subject=\"incorrect filtering\
            of example.org at 1621902483\"",
           "https://mistakes.example.net?domain=example.org?\
            time=1621902483",
           "tel:+18305551212"
         ],
         "justification": "malware present for 23 days",
         "name": "example.net Filtering Service",
         "regulation": "https://laws.example.net?country=atlantis"
       }
     ]
   }

   An example with two entities, "example.com" and "example.net", that
   have filtered a DNS query is shown in Figure 2, below.

       }

5.  Deployment Considerations

   Over time a domain name may be considered risky, then safe, then
   risky again, and later can elapse between the DNS EDNS0 error and the
   user reporting a false positive and the DNS filtering service
   receiving the user's complaint.  Thus the URI is RECOMMENDED to
   include sufficient detail to determine the state when the DNS EDNS0
   response was generated.  How this is encoded into the URI is an
   implementation decision.

   As discussed in the Introduction, some deployment models allow the
   DNS filter provider to be conveyed to the end-user.  This can be
   conveyed with a single "responsible" array by encoding the upstream
   DNS Error URI as an URL encoded parameter.

   An array allows multiple DNS filters to be provided by specialized
   services.  For example, one service might filter access to malicious

   domains and another filters domains due to an internal security
   policy or court order.

6.  Usability Considerations

   The JSON values returned SHOULD be returned in the user's preferred
   language as expressed by the Accept-Language HTTP header.

7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations inherent to the use of DNS Error Page URI are
   discussed in Section 7 of [I-D.reddy-dnsop-error-page].

   The structure data includes URLs that may be misused to return
   infected or compromised websites.  Means to detect and avoid such URL
   are recommended.  Likewise, contact URIs and telephone numbers may be
   misused to return third-party contact points and thus lead to spam
   these contacts.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the "application/
   json+structured-dns-error" media type in the "Media Types" registry
   [IANA-MediaTypes].  This registration follows the procedures
   specified in [RFC6838]:
