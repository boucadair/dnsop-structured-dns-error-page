    <abstract>
      <t>It can be valuable to communicate computer-parsable details about DNS
      filtering to assist troubleshooting and problem resolution. This
      document describes structured data to provide these details.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>DNS clients using services which perform filtering may wish
      to receive more information about such filtering and the reason
      for that filtering. To this end,
      <xref target="RFC8914" format="default">Extended DNS Error Codes</xref> provide information about when
      different types of filtering have occurred, and <xref target="I-D.reddy-dnsop-error-page" format="default">DNS Access                                                                                             
      Denied Error Page</xref> provides a URI to give further
      information to the end-user about the reasons for the
      filtering. However, the latter draft assumes a client with a
      user-interface that can display a web page to the end-user,
      whereas many clients may in fact be "headless", i.e., acting on
      behalf of other network elements; such clients can include DNS
      forwarders and proxies. Such clients cannot make use of a
      web-page designed for presentation to an end-user, but may
      instead be able to make use of structured data. This draft
      provides a mechanism for such clients to request and receive
      structured data from the URI returned by the DNS Access Denied
      Error Page mechanism, allowing the client to parse and display
      this information using its own user interface.</t>
      <t>When a third party provides DNS filtering, there are
      deployments where disclosing that third party to the host (which
      originated the DNS query) is desirable but other deployments
      where such disclosure is not desired.  For example, the IT
      organization might contract filtering to a third party but want
      trouble-tickets from employees to be handled by IT, rather than
      having employees interact directly with the third party.  As
      another example, all the employees at a small business or all
      the members of a household might be informed of the third party
      so they can troubleshoot filtering with that third party
      directly.</t>
      <!--
      
      <t>There are two architectures commonly deployed from the perspective of
      the DNS forwarder when it receives a DNS query from an endpoint: <list
          style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Parallel:">Two DNS queries are generated, one to a DNS
          filtering service and another one to a recursive resolver. If the
          response from the DNS filtering service indicates that the DNS query
          should be filtered, the response from the recursive resolver is
          dropped and a filtered response is sent in response to the original
          query. This architecture is often used in home network
          deployments.</t>

          <t hangText="Serial:">One DNS query is generated to the recursive
          resolver, which itself interacts with a DNS filtering service. This
          relationship with the DNS filtering service might be partially or
          fully withheld (that is, not disclosed) from the end-user or might
          be information available to the end-user. This architecture is often
          used in enterprise networks.</t>

      <name>Deployment Considerations</name>
      <t>Over time a domain name may be considered risky, then safe, then
      risky again, and later can elapse between the DNS EDNS0 error and the
      user reporting a false positive and the DNS filtering service receiving
      the user's complaint. Thus the URI is RECOMMENDED to include sufficient
      detail to determine the state when the DNS EDNS0 response was generated.
      How this is encoded into the URI is an implementation decision.</t>
      <t>As discussed in the Introduction, some deployment models
      allow the DNS filter provider to be conveyed to the end-user. In
      such a deployment, state can be avoided in the DNS forwarder by
      conveying the DNS filter provider's URL in the URL sent to the
      user.  For example, if the upstream DNS filter provider
      (example.net) indicates their structured DNS error page for a
      query to example.org is
      https://example.net?f=example.org&amp;s=38, that URL can be conveyed
      to the user as the URL-encoded parameter
      https%3A%2F%2Fexample.net%3Ff%3Dexample.org%26s%3D38229 appended
      to the DNS forwarder's DNS error page URL.</t>
      <t>An array allows multiple DNS filters to be provided by specialized
      services. For example, one service might filter access to malicious
      domains and another filters domains due to an internal security policy
      or court order.</t>

      <t>The structure data includes URLs that may be misused to return

              <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) is defined in literally dozens of different RFCs.  The terminology used by implementers and developers of DNS protocols, and by operators of DNS systems, has sometimes changed in the decades since the DNS was first defined.  This document gives current definitions for many of the terms used in the DNS in a single document.</t>

              <t>This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in width-bounded text content.  One strategy, called the "single backslash" strategy, is based on the historical use of a single backslash ('\') character to indicate where line-folding has occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character that is not a space character (' ') on the next line.  The second strategy, called the "double backslash" strategy, extends the first strategy by adding a second backslash character to identify where the continuation begins and is thereby able to handle cases not supported by the first strategy.  Both strategies use a self-describing header enabling automated reconstitution of the original content.</t>

              <t>This document describes the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide privacy for DNS.  Encryption provided by TLS eliminates opportunities for eavesdropping and on-path tampering with DNS queries in the network, such as discussed in RFC 7626.  In addition, this document specifies two usage profiles for DNS over TLS and provides advice on performance considerations to minimize overhead from using TCP and TLS with DNS.</t>
              <t>This document focuses on securing stub-to-recursive traffic, as per the charter of the DPRIVE Working Group.  It does not prevent future applications of the protocol to recursive-to-authoritative traffic.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>   This document describes the use of QUIC to provide transport privacy
   for DNS.  The encryption provided by QUIC has similar properties to
   that provided by TLS, while QUIC transport eliminates the head-of-
   line blocking issues inherent with TCP and provides more efficient
   error corrections than UDP.  DNS over QUIC (DoQ) has privacy
   properties similar to DNS over TLS (DoT) specified in RFC7858, and
   latency characteristics similar to classic DNS over UDP.
