    <abstract>
      <t>It can be valuable to communicate computer-parsable details about DNS
      filtering to assist troubleshooting and problem resolution. This
      document describes structured data to provide these details.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Where DNS filtering is provided by an
      entity other than the DNS forwarder itself, it is desirable to propagate
      some information from the DNS filter provider to the end-user to
      understand the reason for the filtering and to troubleshoot false
      positives. This document describes a complement to <xref
      target="I-D.reddy-dnsop-error-page"></xref> where computer-parsable data
      can be exchanged between systems.</t>

      <t>There are two architectures commonly deployed from the perspective of
      the DNS forwarder when it receives a DNS query from an endpoint: <list
          style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Parallel:">Two DNS queries are generated, one to a DNS
          filtering service and another one to a recursive resolver. If the
          response from the DNS filtering service indicates that the DNS query
          should be filtered, the response from the recursive resolver is
          dropped and a filtered response is sent in response to the original
          query. This architecture is often used in home network
          deployments.</t>

          <t hangText="Serial:">One DNS query is generated to the recursive
          resolver, which itself interacts with a DNS filtering service. This
          relationship with the DNS filtering service might be partially or
          fully withheld (that is, not disclosed) from the end-user or might
          be information available to the end-user. This architecture is often
          used in enterprise networks.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

      <t>'Encrypted DNS' refers to any encrypted scheme to convey DNS
      messages, for example, DNS-over-HTTPS <xref target="RFC8484"></xref>,

    </section>

    <section anchor="format-sec" title="Structured Data">
      <t>To receive structured DNS error page data, the client MUST query the
      Error Page URI returned in <xref
      target="I-D.reddy-dnsop-error-page"></xref> with Content-Type set to
      "application/json+structured-dns-error". The JSON has one top-level
      name, "responsible", containing an array of dictionaries for each party
      responsible for this particular DNS filter. An array of responsible
      parties are possible in deployment scenarios where two or more entities
      are involved in a DNS filtering (the filtering may be for the same or
      distinct reasons by each involved DNS filter service). The content of
      the array is structured are as follows:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="complaint:">Is an array of URIs for the user to report
          mis-classified DNS filtering. This is likely to solely contain an
          "https" URI, but an array is provided in case telephone numbers or
          email or other URIs are necessary. This field is mandatory and MUST
          contain at least one URI.</t>

          <t hangText="justification:">Includes the textual justification for
          this particular DNS filtering. This field is optional.</t>

          <t hangText="name:">is the human-friendly name of the organization
          that filtered this particular DNS query. This field is optional.</t>

          <t hangText="regulation:">the URI of the regulation authority for
          this DNS query being filtered. This might point at an employment
          agreement (for an enterprise performing filtering) or a national
          government regulation (for an ISP performing filtering). This field
          is optional.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The JSON data can be displayed to the user, logged, or otherwise used
      to assist the end-user or IT staff with troubleshooting and diagnosing
      the cause of the DNS filtering.</t>

    <section title="Deployment Considerations">
      <t>Over time a domain name may be considered risky, then safe, then
      risky again, and later can elapse between the DNS EDNS0 error and the
      user reporting a false positive and the DNS filtering service receiving
      the user's complaint. Thus the URI is RECOMMENDED to include sufficient
      detail to determine the state when the DNS EDNS0 response was generated.
      How this is encoded into the URI is an implementation decision.</t>

      <t>As discussed in the Introduction, some deployment models allow the
      DNS filter provider to be conveyed to the end-user. This can be conveyed
      with a single "responsible" array by encoding the upstream DNS Error URI
      as an URL encoded parameter.</t>

      <t>An array allows multiple DNS filters to be provided by specialized
      services. For example, one service might filter access to malicious
      domains and another filters domains due to an internal security policy
      or court order.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Usability Considerations">
      <t>The JSON values returned SHOULD be returned in the user's preferred
      language as expressed by the Accept-Language HTTP header.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Security considerations inherent to the use of DNS Error Page URI are
      discussed in Section 7 of <xref
      target="I-D.reddy-dnsop-error-page"></xref>. </t>

      <t>The structure data includes URLs that may be misused to return
      infected or compromised websites. Means to detect and avoid such URL are
      recommended. Likewise, contact URIs and telephone numbers may be misused
      to return third-party contact points and thus lead to spam these
      contacts.</t>
