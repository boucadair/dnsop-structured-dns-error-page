1.  Introduction

   In DNS filtering scnearios where DNS filtering is provided by an
   entity other than the recursive resolver itself, it is desirable to
   propagate information from the DNS filter provider to the end user to
   assist with understanding the reason the DNS response was filtered
   and to troubleshoot false positives.  There are two architectures
   commonly deployed from the perspective of the local recursive
   resolver when it receives a DNS query from an endpoint:

   o  parallel: Two DNS queries are generated, one to a DNS filtering
      service, the other to recursive resolver.  If the response from
      the filtering service indicates the DNS query should be filtered,
      the response from the recursive resolver is dropped and a filtered
      response is sent in response to the original query.

   o  serial: One DNS query is generated to the recursive resolver,
      which itself interacts with a DNS filtering service.  This
      relationship with the DNS filtering service might be partially or
      fully withheld (that is, not disclosed) from the end- user or
      might be information available to the end user.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499].

   'Encrypted DNS' refers to any encrypted scheme to convey DNS
   messages, for example, DNS-over-HTTPS [RFC8484], DNS-over-TLS
   [RFC7858], or DNS-over-QUIC [I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsoquic].

3.  Structured Data

   To receive structured DNS error page data, the client queries the
   Error Page URI returned in [reddy-dnsop-structured-dns-error] with
   Content-Type: application/json+structured-dns-error.  The JSON has
   one top-level name, responsible, containing an array of dictionaries
   for each party responsible for this particular DNS filter.  An array
   of responsible parties are possible in deployment scenarios where two
   or more entities both performed DNS filtering (perhaps for the same
   reason, perhaps for different reasons).  The contents of the array
   are as follows:

   complaint:  an array of URIs for the user to report mis-classified
      DNS filtering.  This will often solely contain an https URI, but
      an array is provided in case telephone or email or other URIs are
      necessary.  This field is mandatory, and MUST contain at least one
      URI.

   justification:  textual justification for this particular DNS
      filtering.  This field is optional.

   name  the human-friendly name of the organization that filtered this
      particular DNS query.  This field is optional.

   regulation  the URI of the regulation authority for this DNS query
      being filtered.  This might point at an employment agreement (for
      an enterprise performing filtering) or a national government
      regulation (for an ISP performing filtering).  This field is
      optional.

   The JSON data can be displayed to the user, logged, or otherwise used
   to assist the end-user or IT staff with troubleshooting and
   diagnosing the cause of the DNS filtering.

4.  Examples

   In all examples, line wraps are necessary for formatting this
   document, not for the JSON.

   Example with one entity, example.net, that has filtered a DNS query:

   {
     "responsible": [{
       "complaint": ["mailto:mistakes@example.net?subject=\"incorrect
   filtering of example.org at 1621902483\"",
   "https://mistakes.example.net?mistake=example.org?time=1621902483",
   "tel:+18305551212"
       ],
       "justification" : "malware present for 23 days",
       "name": "Example.net Filtering Service",
       "regulation": "https://laws.example.net?country=atlantis"
     }]
   }

   Example with two entities, example.com and example.net, that have
   filtered a DNS query:

   {
     "responsible": [{
       "complaint": ["mailto:mistakes@example.net?subject=\"incorrect
   filtering of example.org at 1621902483\"",
   "https://mistake.example.net?mistake=example.org?time=1621902483",
   "tel:+18305551212"
       ],
       "justification" : "malware present for 23 days",
       "name": "Example.net Filtering Service",
       "regulation": "https://laws.example.net?country=atlantis"
     }, {
       "complaint": ["mailto:abuse@example.com?subject=\"false positive
   filtering example.org on 24-May-2021 5:03 GMT\"",
                     "https://example.net/report?d=example.org?t=38233",
                     "tel:+5305551212"
       ],
       "justification" : "command and control malware",
       "name": "Example.Com IT department",
       "regulation": "https://hr.example.com?state=AK"
    }]
   }

5.  Deployment Considerations

   Over time a domain may be considered risky, then safe, then risky
   again, and minutes or hours can elapse between the DNS EDNS0 error
   and the user reporting a false positive and the DNS filtering service
   receiving the user's complaint.  Thus the URI is RECOMMENDED to
   include sufficient detail to determine the state when the DNS EDNS0

Internet-Draft        DNS Access Denied Error Page             June 2021


   response was generated.  How this is encoded into the URI is an
   implementation decision.

   As discussed in the Introduction, some deployment models allow the
   DNS filter provider to be conveyed to the end user.  This can be
   conveyed with a single Responsible array by encoding the upstream DNS
   error URI as a URL encoded parameter.

   An array allows multiple DNS filters to be provided by specialized
   services.  For example, one service might filter malware distribution
   while another service filters malware command and control, another
   filters malicious look-like login pages, and the fourth is a bespoke
   system used by a consortium of enterprises in the same business space
   (e.g., financial companies).

6.  Usability Considerations

   The JSON values returned SHOULD be returned in the user's preferred
   language as expressed by the Accept-Language HTTP header.

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

8.  IANA Considerations

   New registry for application/json+structured-dns-error.
