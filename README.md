# dnsop-structured-dns-error-page

   DNS filtering is widely deployed for network security, but filtered
   DNS responses lack information for the end user to understand the
   reason for the filtering.  Existing mechanisms to provide detail to
   end users cause harm especially if the blocked DNS response is to an
   HTTPS website.

   This document defines a mechanism to explain the reason for the DNS
   filtering and provides a HTTPS URIs to get more detail.  This
   information can be parsed by the client and displayed, logged, or
   used for other purposes.
